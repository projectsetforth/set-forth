                <p>
                    As the population of Dublin begins to grow, the need for an application that can help organize people’s transportation schedules grows as well.

                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p class="wakanda">
                    We wanted to create a website/app that connects to a button/clicker using a Raspberry Pi 3 B model motherboard along with the actual button module itself. The device itself will be implemented into bus seats by implementing them underneath the seat covers. The website itself will contain the data for the buses, displaying which bus you want to see data for, as well as a birds-eye view blueprint of the bus along with shaded seats to represent taken seats. 
                    This section will also show the current capacity of the bus in comparison to the seats as well. Other small features will be added to the website, such as routes, tracking devices, and drop off locations, but those features will be added if time is there. The main focus is to track bus capacity via small button modules that can track taken seats in comparison to the total amount of seats.
                    The goal of this year’s Entrepreneur project is to get a simple working prototype of a button module using devices such as the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B motherboards and a button module, which will have their data hooked up to a website that can continuously gather information.
                    There will also be a plastic container designed specifically for the product, designed by the IED student (Eshan Bathula). The Raspberry Pi will contain the data and will be responsible for sending the data to the website and the module for the button tracks the occupancy. This simple stage of prototyping is to build a rough working draft of a true model.
